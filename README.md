# Learn-JavaScript
This repository is a collection of my JavaScript learning journey, covering topics from basic to advanced levels, along with important questions to help prepare for interviews.

I remember how I struggled during my second semester while learning JavaScript. There are countless resources on the internet, and I followed many tutorials to get started with my web development journey, but I was never confident using JavaScript in real projects.

However, while preparing for my interviews recently, I discovered a YouTube channel called **Bro Code**. Their tutorials are easy to understand and come with proper notes and practical implementations, which helped me gain confidence in JavaScript.

So, I decided to share my learning journey with everyone. In this repository, I'll cover each JavaScript topic with explanations, examples, and notes. After completing each topic, I'll also include relevant interview questions to help with interview preparation.

Feel free to follow along, contribute, or provide feedback!
